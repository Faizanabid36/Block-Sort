# Block-Sort
Block sort, or block merge sort, is a sorting algorithm combining at least two merge operations with an insertion sort.
It gets its name from the observation that merging two sorted lists, A and B, is equivalent to breaking A into evenly sized blocks, inserting each A block into B under special rules, and merging AB pairs.
